            She was in a hurry. Not the standard hurry when you're in a rush to
            get someplace, but a frantic hurry. The type of hurry where a few
            seconds could mean life or death. She raced down the road ignoring

She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time.
